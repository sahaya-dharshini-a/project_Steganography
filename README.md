## Secure data hiding in images using Steganography
 
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of image steganography using Python and OpenCV. It allows users to hide text messages within images using a simple Least Significant Bit (LSB) replacement technique.

## Features
* Basic LSB steganography for hiding text messages in images.
* Simple password protection for message retrieval.
* Uses OpenCV for image processing.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

## Installation
1.  Install the required libraries cv2
   pip install opencv-python
    

## Usage
1.  Place the image you want to use (e.g., `mypic.jpg`) in the same directory as the Python script.
2.  Run the Python script:
    python steganography.py
3.  Follow the prompts to enter the secret message and password.
4.  The encrypted image (`Encryptedmsg.jpg`) will be created in the same directory.
5.  To decrypt the message, run the script again and enter the correct password.

## Code Explanation

* **`cv2.imread()` and `cv2.imwrite()`:** Used for reading and writing images.
* **LSB Replacement:** The script replaces the least significant bit of pixel values with the bits of the secret message.
* **Password Protection:** A simple password check is used during decryption.

## Future Scope

* Implement strong encryption (e.g., AES, RSA).
* Use advanced embedding techniques (e.g., DCT, DWT).
* Add steganalysis countermeasures.
* Implement error correction.
* Develop a secure key management system.
* Explore deep learning based steganography.
